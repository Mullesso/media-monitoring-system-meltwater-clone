# "lxml.html.clean" has been extracted from the main lxml package as of lxml 5.2.
# Newspaper3k relies on lxml's HTML cleaner for article parsing. Without the
# separate cleaner package, importing `newspaper` will raise an ImportError
# stating that `lxml.html.clean` has become the independent project
# ``lxml_html_clean``. To resolve this, explicitly install the
# ``lxml_html_clean`` package. See this Medium article for context, which
# explains that when using Newspaper3k, the error can be fixed by installing
# ``lxml_html_clean`` or ``lxml[html_clean]``【110656884634172†L92-L100】.
